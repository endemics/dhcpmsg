dhcpmsg is a c program designed to be called by dnsmasq 
(http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/) every time a lease change occurs.

It will then publish the leases informations to a RESTful web application. At
first, the application will allow to visualise the lease informations. The
final target for that web application however is to help automatic ressource
discovery for unknown machines through dynamic dhcp and to facilitate automatic
deployment via pxe.

Other tools such as an automatic hardware inventory mini-operating system are
also planned. Every tool in the suite will aim at being well defined and
interchangeable. All datas will be exported via publicly defined RESTful APIs
so elements will be loosely linked.

For now, the RESTful web application working together with dhcpmsg is still in
the works, and not yet ready to be published as of 31/12/2009.

If you want to create a stub for tests purposes or a replacement application,
you can use the following API (subject to changes):

create a new entry
------------------
http verb: POST
uri: http://<hostname>[:<port>][/<path>]/by-mac/<mac address>
data: json data containing at least the following fields:
  - "mac": a colon (":") separated mac address
  - "ip": an ipv4 IP address

update an existing entry
------------------------
http verb: PUT
uri: http://<hostname>[:<port>][/<path>]/by-mac/<mac address>
data: json data containing at least the following fields:
  - "mac": a colon (":") separated mac address
  - "ip": an ipv4 IP address

delete an existing entry
------------------------
http verb: DELETE
uri: http://<hostname>[:<port>][/<path>]/by-mac/<mac address>
data: nil
