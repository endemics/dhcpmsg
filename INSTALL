Dependencies
============

To build this software you will need the following dependencies:
- libconfig (tested with version 1.3.2-2 on debian)
- curl (tested with version 7.19.7-1 on debian)
- check (optional, for the test suite, tested with version 0.9.6-2 on debian)

You will also need the autotools, make, gcc etc.

On debian you can install the above dependencies with:

  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev check libconfig8-dev

To run, this software depends on a web application where it pushes the dhcp
information. It also naturally depends on dnsmasq since it is designed to be
used by dnsmasq.

Please note that in order to get the informations between "static" and
dynamic address allocations, you will need dnsmasq with a version >= 2.52

Building and installing
=======================

Since this software uses autotools, it should build with the following:
autoreconf --install && ./configure && make && make install

They are a lot of options you can change that are detailled in the output of
./configure --help

The non-usual ones are:
--enable-check  this will use libtool to compile dhcpmsg with the external
  functions as .la so you can run the test suite using `make check'. The
  default usage is to build a single binary since this is how it can be used
  by dnsmasq

--with-config=/path/to/config this allow to override the default path for the
  configuration file (/etc/dhcpmsg.cfg)

Configuration and usage
=======================

You will need to create a configuration file and place it either in /etc/ under
the name dhcpmsg.cfg or any other alternate name specified by --with-config.

An example configuration file is present in the doc/ directory.

You will also need:
- the webapp to be installed
- dnsmasq to be configured with the --script option pointing to the dhcpmsg binary
